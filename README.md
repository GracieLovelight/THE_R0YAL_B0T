# I.R.I.S., THE R0YAL B0T

 I.R.I.S., THE R0YAL B0T is THE PLAYER ZER0's Discord bot written in Python 3.9 which is specifically made for the PLAYER ZER0 STUDIOS' Discord Server! This is version 2.22.0 - The Update of Less Annoyance. However, when I made this, I didn't realize that it could be my last update.

 As of April 2022, Discord is mandating Slash Commands but I'll be honest, I haven't the foggiest clue of the future of Discord bots. So, here we are!

# Running I.R.I.S., THE R0YAL B0T
 
 If you want to run this bot, all you need to do is install the dependencies, install Python 3.9, make a bot through the Discord API website, copy the token, open Main.py, scroll to the very bottom, remove the word token, add open and closed quotation marks, then paste the token inside of the quotation marks and you're good to go!
